# KingPin
Bowling Web App. 


Project Setup:
Put __init__.py in your chosen directory. Create  'static' and a 'templates' subdirectories. All .htm and .html files belong in 'templates', while all other files belong in 'static'.

To run the webserver, run __init__.py with Python3. Since it listens on port 443 (HTTPS), this may require superuser priveleges. 
Built on Flask 1.0.2 in Python 3.7.5.
